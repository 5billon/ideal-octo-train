# Flat-I-Rent

Flat-I-Rent is a new website trying to build its path in the home renting field! Here you can select through a selection of homes across the United States! Being able to write and read reviews of previous renters to see how they felt about the property!

## Setup

We will need to run the json command to retrieve all the backend information:

```console
$ json-server --watch db.json
```
You can test if this is working from this route:

[http://localhost:3000/houses](http://localhost:3000/houses)

Then after that open your `index.html` file in your browser to run!

## What you can do

From a user prespective there is multiple things you can currently do on our website

1. The first thing you can do is click and each and every home to see more information about the home! 
    Including the Zipcode, amount of bedrooms and bathrooms, the country, state and city is it located, and finally, previous reviewers thoughts!
    Each home will be highlighted whenever you click on them so you know which one you are on!

2. The second thing you can do as a user is quite simple, you can sort through the homes based on what you need in terms of amount of bedrooms and bathrooms!
    Big families are no worry here as some of our homes have up to 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms!

3. The third thing our users can do, is vital to us. You can, after your stay, write your own review and thoughts on your stay! Feedback is one of the most important things for a service of our kind!

## How to get in contact

All of the contact info is along the bottom of the page! Once you find the home you were looking to stay at, just take all your own and the homes information and email to the email at the bottom of the page. A response will follow shortly about availablity and more information regarding the home if needed!
