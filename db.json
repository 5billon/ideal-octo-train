      "review": "The location of this vacation home is perfect- literally a few feet from the beach, however, I was disappointed to find that the handicapped-accessible features like a walk-in shower and rails in the bathroom that were listed in the listing were not present in the actual cottage. The host was friendly and attempted to accommodate, but this made travel with limited mobility much more difficult than expected.",

Several items in the kitchen were badly broken and unusable and the bathroom shower sprayed everywhere- requiring a big cleanup after every shower. Although I contacted the host several times, they never made any attempt to resolve these issues.",

I did a 6-night rest here after hiking through Torres Del Paine and I am so glad I booked my time here. This unit is the farthest from the street, so it is extra quiet and extra private!",

It’s close to the port but there are LOTS of steps between the apartment and the ferry dock. If I stayed here again I’d uber between the apartment to better manage my heavy wheeled luggage.",
