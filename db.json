The host was friendly and attempted to accommodate, but this made travel with limited mobility much more difficult than expected.",

Several items in the kitchen were badly broken and unusable and the bathroom shower sprayed everywhere- requiring a big cleanup after every shower. Although I contacted the host several times, they never made any attempt to resolve these issues.",

It’s close to the port but there are LOTS of steps between the home and the ferry dock. If I stayed here again I’d uber between the home and dock to better manage my heavy wheeled luggage.",
